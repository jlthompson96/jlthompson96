### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Joseph(Joey)!

Passionate software engineer with a proven track record in modernizing applications and driving efficiencies. Currently serving as an Associate Vice President at Wells Fargo, where I lead initiatives in application modernization, leveraging technologies like React.js, Java 17, and Spring 6. Over the past year, I've spearheaded the transformation of a Java 8 SpringBoot application into a micro services architecture deployed on Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

In addition to my technical contributions, I'm dedicated to mentorship, having supported interns, contractors, and new team members to foster a culture of learning and growth. My background also includes part-time roles in IT systems and service management, where I've honed my skills in infrastructure maintenance, network security, and client support.
